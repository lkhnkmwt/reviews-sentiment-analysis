# reviews-sentiment-analysis
## Motivation
As a student, the term 'sentiment analysis' always fascinated me. I wondered wheter it is anyhow connected with the human sentiments.
And when I explored it, I got to know about many concepts of technology related with the Natural Language processing and how big companies are using this strategy to know about the feedback of their products.
So I thought to make a project on this with a real dataset which is scraped by me.
